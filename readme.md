# AZNet repository
This repo contains AZNet related content, from ARM templates to Bicep to YAML. I will try to keep things organised! Most folders will be part of a blog post, or some sort of test.

## Requests
See a template that I have, that you need a modification of? Fork away! Similarly, if you see something that could, or should, be tweaked, submit a PR or Issue!

## Questions
If you have any, or would just like to follow me, you can find me on Twitter [@wedoAzure](https://twitter.com/wedoazure) and don't forget to use the hashtag [#AZNet](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AZNet)
